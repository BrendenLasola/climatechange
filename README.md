Shiny App: https://yunghiro.shinyapps.io/co2_climatechange/

Created a shiny app that showed the different ways C02 is being emmitted in the USA over the years.  
The goal of this project was to get better at using the shiny app, I initially tried to use different files for server and ui but it wasn't publishing the app.
I created a new app.r that had both analysis, ui, and server. This worked perfectly
